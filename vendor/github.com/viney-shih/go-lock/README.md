**go-lock** is a Golang library implementing an effcient read-write lock with the following built-in mechanism:
- Mutex
- Trylock
- No-starve read-write solution

Native `sync/Mutex` and `sync/RWMutex` are very powerful and reliable. However, it became a disaster if the lock was not released as expected. Or someone was holding the lock too long at the peak time. It slowed down whole system. Dealing with those cases, **go-lock** implements TryLock, TryLockWithTimeout and TryLockWithContext function in addition to Lock and Unlock. It provides flexibility to control the resources.

## Installation

```sh
go get github.com/viney-shih/go-lock
```

## Example
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync/atomic"
	"time"

	lock "github.com/viney-shih/go-lock"
)

func main() {
	// initialized with default value
	casMut := lock.NewCASMutex()
	count := int32(0)

	casMut.Lock()
	go func() {
		time.Sleep(50 * time.Millisecond)
		fmt.Println("Now is", atomic.AddInt32(&count, 1)) // Now is 1
		casMut.Unlock()
	}()

	casMut.Lock()
	fmt.Println("Now is", atomic.AddInt32(&count, 2)) // Now is 3

	// TryLock without blocking
	fmt.Println("Return", casMut.TryLock()) // Return false

	// RTryLockWithTimeout without blocking
	fmt.Println("Return", casMut.RTryLockWithTimeout(50*time.Millisecond)) // Return false
	casMut.Unlock()

	// Output:
	// Now is 1
	// Now is 3
	// Return false
	// Return false
}
```
